## 🚀 Behind the Curtains  

Building this portfolio was a great learning journey. Some highlights:  

- **Framework & Styling:** Built with **Next.js + TypeScript** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, minimal, and modern design.  
- **Hosting:** Deployed on **Vercel** with my own **custom domain**.  
- **Assets:** Used the `public/` folder to manage SVGs for project logos and my downloadable Resume (`Resume.pdf`).  
- **Projects Showcase:** Created reusable `ProjectCard` components with status labels (`Work in Progress` vs `Completed`).  
- **Resume Button:** Integrated a direct download button that serves my PDF resume straight from the website.  
- **Debugging & Fixes:**  
  - Resolved TypeScript prop typing issues for components.  
  - Fixed import/export mismatches (`default` vs named exports).  
  - Adjusted for case sensitivity issues during Vercel deployment (Linux environment).
